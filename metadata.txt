about=This plugin rotates all or only selected polygons within chosen distance (from line to polygon centroid) parallel to the nearest line segment if angle <= chosen angle value. May be useful when working with streets and buildings or with regular grids and buildings. If both angles between polygon edges and line segment <= 'Angle value', rotates by minimal angle value by default (can be change in settings to rotating by longer edge).
