about=This plugin rotates all or only selected polygons within chosen distance (from line to polygon centroid) parallel to the nearest line segment if angle <= chosen angle value. May be useful when working with streets and buildings. It is strongly recommended that you check your data for geometry errors before using the plugin.

        - much faster
        - possibility to write to the new layer all or only selected polygons
        - possibility to rotate or not rotate multipolygons
        - each polyline of the multipolyline is processed as a separate
        - the new "_rotated" field is not duplicated if it already exists
    0.2.1
        - translation into Russian and Ukrainian
    0.2
